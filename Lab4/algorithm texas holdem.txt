Notes
-	This is a real life game aka the Texas Hold’em. This poker game features betting and multi-player in real life. But for this project, it also can feature betting, a computer-player mode, and a multi-player mode
-	For multiple player mode, the maximum number should no more than 10, but the minimum number should always be greater or equal to 2. 
-	This game is not possible to run out of cards because each player gets two cards only, and five cards are being used on the table as community cards
-	The users will have the chance to give up the round, or to pass the round or to raise money if they wish so.
-	As for betting, this game can enable or disable the betting feature. If betting is enabled, player can raise money to scare his/her opponents if he/she thinks they have a good chance of winning. For this game, the betting feature should be easy to add or delete since it comes with the give-up and pass features. But certainly, with betting featured, it will make the game more exciting and dramatic.
-	If the players play this game remotely, there is a chance of them cheating like what may happen in all games. Since the 2 private cards are pivotal to playing Texas Hold’em poker game, it will be unfair for the players if some of them expose their private cards to each other.

Thoughts on Implementation
-	The most difficult part for this game has to be determining the winning conditions. As listed above, there are so many possibilities of how the game will end due to various combinations of kinds and suits.
