2.	set the capacity to 20
3.	initialize all passengers from the array as passengers

Current Station
1.	get current station from 
2.	return current station  

Disembark and Board
1.	passengers whos destinations are equal to the station is removed
2.	count however many passengers leave the train
3.	add said number of passengers until capacity is full

Interval

Get passenger destination
1.	iterate through all passengers on the train 
2.	get their destination from passenger class

Turn around
1.	checks to see if the train has reached the station at the end
2.	then changes the direction variable to west if east or if east to west
